### Project Overview
---
The Company seeks to obtain the comprehensive analysis of its customer data for its subscription service across a defined period to gain valuable insights into customer segmentation & trends, customers behavior, track subscription types, key trends in cancellations & renewals and regional performances.

### Problem
---
This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify segments and trends. The goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types, and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals
In this project, I was tasked with;
1. Analyzing Customer data for a subscription service
2. Exploring Customer data to uncover key insights such as:
   i. Customer Behavior,
  ii. Track subscription types,
 iii. identify key trends in cancellations and renewals,
  iv. Regional Performances.
   
### Process
---
So, how did I tackle this problem?
Well I approached it in 5 steps:
1. Data understanding - the key to success on any data project is to understand 
the data in detail. So I took the time to understand the data model and 
domain of the business.
2. Data cleaning - after understanding the data, I then cleaned the 
available datasets and thought about what an ideal dataset should look like for 
this problem.
3. Data modelling - After ensuring the data was clean for analysis, I needed 
to process and model this data into a dataset that can precisely answer the 
business questions and produce the results needed.
4. Data analysis - With the new dataset, I used my analytical expertise to 
uncover insights from this dataset and to produce visualizations to describe the 
insights.
5. And finally I used these insights to unlock business decisions and to make 
recommendations on next steps.

### Project Overview
---
The Internet Provider Company seeks to obtain the comprehensive analysis of its customer data for its subscription service across a defined period to gain valuable insights into customer segmentation & trends, customers behavior, track subscription types, key trends in cancellations & renewals and regional performances.

### Problem
---
This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify segments and trends. The goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types, and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals
In this project, I was tasked with;
1. Analyzing Customer data for a subscription service
2. Exploring Customer data to uncover key insights such as:
   - Customer Behavior,
   - Track subscription types,
   - identify key trends in cancellations and renewals,
   - Regional Performances.

### Dataset Used
---
1. Subscription Type- these are the types of subscription the Retail store offers 
2. Subscription Start- this is the date when the customer subscription type commenced
3. Subscription End- this is the date when the subscription ends
4. Subscription Duration- this is how long the subscription service is for. Calculated as; (Subscription end- Subscription start)
5. Cancellations
6. Region
7. Revenue

### Tools Used
---
1. Microsoft Excel [Download here][LITA Capstone Dataset.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17551135/LITA.Capstone.Dataset.xlsx)
   - for Data cleaning
   - for Summarisation of the data
   - for Visualisation
2. SQL Server [Download here][Uploading SQLQueryPROJECT-CUSTOMERDATA.sql‚Ä¶]()
   - for data querying
3. Microsoft PowerBI [Download here]
    - for Summarisation of the dataset and
    - for Visualisations
4. Github- for profile building
   
### Process
---
So, how did I tackle this problem?
Well I approached it in 5 steps:
1. Data understanding - the key to success on any data project is to understand 
the data in detail. So I took the time to understand the data model and 
domain of the business. This was done using the following tools;
   - Microsoft Excel
     - The use of conditional formatting to check for duplicates
     - Pivot Table- to summarise the data
   - Microsoft Power BI- using the Transform data page to check for null values and errors.
3. Data cleaning - after understanding the data, I then cleaned the 
available datasets and thought about what an ideal dataset should look like for 
this problem.
4. Data modelling - After ensuring the data was clean for analysis, I needed 
to process and model this data into a dataset that can precisely answer the 
business questions and produce the results needed.
5. Data analysis - With the new dataset, I used my analytical expertise to 
uncover insights from this dataset and to produce visualizations to describe the 
insights.
6. And finally I used these insights to unlock business decisions and to make 
recommendations on next steps.
